##  B. ABSTRACT 

Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in the form of a computerised database using strong cryptography to protect transaction records, monitor the production of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership. A cryptocurrency, crypto currency, or crypto is a digital asset intended to function as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in the form of a computerised database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.

It is not usually distributed by a central authority and does not occur in tangible form (like paper money). In contrast to centralised digital money and central banking schemes, cryptocurrencies usually use decentralised power. A cryptocurrency is called centralised whether it is minted or produced prior to issuance, or whether it is issued by a single issuer.

Each cryptocurrency, when applied with shared power, uses distributed ledger technology, usually a blockchain, to act as a public financial transaction database.

## C.  DATASET

This project to forecast cryptocurrency prices using all the trading features like price, volume, open, high, low values present in the dataset.

The dataset contains total of 5 features. The details for them are as follows:

1. Close Price — It is the market close price for currency for that particular day.
2. High Price — It is highest price of currency for the day.
3. Low Price — It is the lowest price for currency for that day.
4. Open Price — It is market open price for currency for that day.
5. Volume — The volume of currency that is being in trade for that day.
