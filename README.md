##  B. ABSTRACT 

Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in the form of a computerised database using strong cryptography to protect transaction records, monitor the production of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership. A cryptocurrency, crypto currency, or crypto is a digital asset intended to function as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in the form of a computerised database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.

It is not usually distributed by a central authority and does not occur in tangible form (like paper money). In contrast to centralised digital money and central banking schemes, cryptocurrencies usually use decentralised power. A cryptocurrency is called centralised whether it is minted or produced prior to issuance, or whether it is issued by a single issuer.

Each cryptocurrency, when applied with shared power, uses distributed ledger technology, usually a blockchain, to act as a public financial transaction database.

## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
- Detect face masks in real-time video streams

We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our face mask detector.


There is two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector as shown in Figure 2:

Figure 2: Phases and individual steps for building a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision and deep learning 

In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps (as shown by Figure 1 above):

- Training: Here we’ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras/TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk

- Deployment: Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask

We’ll review each of these phases and associated subsets in detail in the remainder of this tutorial, but in the meantime, let’s take a look at the dataset we’ll be using to train our COVID-19 face mask detector.


Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset as shown in Figure 3:

![Figure 3](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_dataset.jpg)

Figure 3: A face mask detection dataset consists of “with mask” and “without mask” images. 

The dataset we’ll be using here today was created by PyImageSearch reader Prajna Bhandary.

This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:

- with_mask: 690 images
- without_mask: 686 images

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether a person is or is not wearing a mask.

How was our face mask dataset created?
Prajna, like me, has been feeling down and depressed about the state of the world — thousands of people are dying each day, and for many of us, there is very little (if anything) we can do.

To help keep her spirits up, Prajna decided to distract herself by applying computer vision and deep learning to solve a real-world problem:

- Best case scenario — she could use her project to help others
- Worst case scenario — it gave her a much needed mental escape
